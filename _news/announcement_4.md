Finished my summer internship with <a href="https://www.blackriversystems.com/">Black River Systems Inc.</a> as a systems engineer intern. I worked on collecting and performing unsupervised clustering of a variety of radio signals found in the field.

[//]: # I developed "band-agnostic" features which can categorize a wide-range of different modulation protocol, and performed unsupervised clustering to find signals of interest.
