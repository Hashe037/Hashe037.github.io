Finished my summer internship with <a href="url">Black River Systems Inc.</a> as a systems engineer intern! I worked on collecting and analyzing radio signals. I developed "band-agnostic" features which can categorize a wide-range of different modulation protocol, and performed unsupervised clustering to find signals of interest.
