Presented and published two of my works at the IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (<a href="https://iccp2023.iccp-conference.org/">ICCP</a>)conference in Madison, one on "Parallax-Driven Denoising of Passive Non-Line-of-Sight Thermal Imagery" and the other on "Isolating Signals in Passive Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging using Spectral Content" (which was also accepted into the TPAMI Special Issue).
