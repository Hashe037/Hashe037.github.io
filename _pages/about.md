I am a PhD student in electrical engineering at the <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/ece'>University of Minnesota ECE Department</a> under Dr. James Leger.

My primary research is in the domain of computational imaging, which is the intersection between optics, signal processing, and computer vision. My thesis is focused on creating noiseless and clutterless reconstructions in passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging using information beyond what is typically used for conventional imaging. I have expertise in inverse problems, machine learning, data fusion, and programming.

I am open to other opportunities and new research, so please feel free to reach me at my email hashe037@umn.edu
